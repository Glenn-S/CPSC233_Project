Synopsis: B-town is under attack by “I can’t believe it’s not butter” boy and
his army of Margarine men. All sources of butter are destroyed in the town
except for one. Your best friend Butter Bob Brown has been in his lab developing
a new 0 sodium butter. Realizing the applications for his process of removing
sodium, “I can’t believe it’s not butter” boy abducts him to his lair of oil.
After remembering something the town oracle spoke of in the past you see the
ancient scriptures in the town describing a hero of legend who would save the
Butter Industry from its competitors. Here you acquire the bronze butter knife
and styrofoam plate shield.  Now it’s up to you to assemble the holy
triglyceride (combination of the 3 “keys” which will be known as monoglycerides)
and rescue Butter Bob Brown to restore peace to the Butter Industry.

from grocery shopping seeing everything in ruin. You will then see a ransom note
from “I can’t believe it’s not butter” boy explaining how your friend is
